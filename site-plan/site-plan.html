Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->

      <h2>Wireframes</h2>
      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them
        here
      </p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>
        Unfortunately I didn't have time to make as detailed a wireframe as the
        other pages, even though I know this borders more on the side of a
        mockup I believe it serves the exact same purpose as a wireframe with
        colors and images added in.
      </p>

      <h3>Services</h3>

        width="auto"
      />

      <h3>Testimonials</h3>
      <p>
        Each of the tesimonial blocks once clicked on will show the package that
        company used and display a CTA button that will direct them to our
        services page. For the main company in the middle it will show their
        package and the different services and strategies we implemented for
        them.
